Business Rules:
Business Rules:
1. The program reads data from an input file and writes the processed data to an output file.
2. The input file must be opened for reading and the output file must be opened for writing.
3. The program continues to read input records until it encounters the end of file marker ("EOF").
4. Each input record consists of three fields: Field1, Field2, and Field3.
5. Each output record consists of three result fields: ResultField1, ResultField2, and ResultField3.
6. The program processes the data by copying the values from the input fields to the corresponding result fields.
7. After processing each input record, the program writes the output record to the output file.
8. If an error occurs during the execution of the program, an error message can be stored in the ErrorMessage variable.
9. The program stops running after all input records have been processed and written to the output file.

Test Cases:
Test Case ID | Test Scenario | Test Case | Pre-Condition | Test Steps | Test Data | Expected Result
------------|---------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|-----------|-----------------
1           | Normal Input  | Read-Input-Record | InputFile is open | 1. Read InputRecord from InputFile | InputRecord = "EOF" | Move "EOF" to InputRecord
2           | Normal Input  | Process-Data | InputRecord is not "EOF" | 1. Move Field1 to ResultField1 2. Move Field2 to ResultField2 3. Move Field3 to ResultField3 4. Write OutputRecord | - | ResultField1 = Field1, ResultField2 = Field2, ResultField3 = Field3
3           | End of File   | Read-Input-Record | InputFile is open | 1. Read InputRecord from InputFile | InputRecord = "EOF" | Move "EOF" to InputRecord
4           | Empty Input   | Process-Data | InputRecord is not "EOF" | 1. Move Field1 to ResultField1 2. Move Field2 to ResultField2 3. Move Field3 to ResultField3 4. Write OutputRecord | Field1 = "", Field2 = 0, Field3 = "" | ResultField1 = "", ResultField2 = 0, ResultField3 = ""
5           | Invalid Input | Process-Data | InputRecord is not "EOF" | 1. Move Field1 to ResultField1 2. Move Field2 to ResultField2 3. Move Field3 to ResultField3 4. Write OutputRecord | Field1 = "Invalid", Field2 = 123456, Field3 = "Invalid" | ResultField1 = "Invalid", ResultField2 = 123456, ResultField3 = "Invalid"

Business Rules:
Business Rules:
1. The program is designed to process payroll information for employees.
2. The Employee-Record data structure contains fields for Employee Name, Employee ID, Hours Worked, Hourly Rate, and Gross Pay.
3. The Total-Gross-Pay field is used to keep track of the total gross pay for all employees.
4. The Employee-Count field is used to keep track of the total number of employees processed.
5. The program reads employee records from a file named EmployeeFile.
6. The file contains records with fields for Employee Name, Employee ID, Hours Worked, and Hourly Rate.
7. The program processes each employee record by calculating the gross pay based on the hours worked and hourly rate.
8. The gross pay is calculated by multiplying the hours worked by the hourly rate.
9. The program displays the employee name, employee ID, and gross pay for each employee.
10. After processing all employee records, the program displays the total gross pay and the total number of employees processed.
11. The program stops running after displaying the payroll report.
